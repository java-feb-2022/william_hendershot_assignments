CategoryRepository
Some derived queries you may need to get you started..

    // Retrieves a list of all categories for a particular product
    List<Category> findAllByProducts(Product product);
    
    // Retrieves a list of any categories a particular product
    // does not belong to.
    List<Category> findByProductsNotContains(Product product);copy
Note: No Middle Model Needed
For this assignment you need only implement two models: Product and Category. Since there is no extra data required for the relationship, you do not need a middle model, that is, you do not need a class to handle the joiner table in the database.
