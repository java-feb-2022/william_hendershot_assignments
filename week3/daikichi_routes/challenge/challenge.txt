Daikichi Routes
Daikichi (大吉) means "excellent luck" or "great blessing". We will be creating a website that will deliver a message of good fortune based on which url path is typed into the browser. For this assignment, you are going to practice routes in Spring Boot. The goal is to master writing method level @RequestMapping annotations and @RequestMapping class level annotation.

Objectives:
Create a Spring Boot application using Spring Tool Suite.
Create a controller using the @RestController annotation.
Use request mapping and @RequestMapping annotations to have distinct URL endpoints return different messages.

Assignment
Create an app that will show in the browser either a welcome message or a fortune, based on which URL is typed in the browser. Please note, you may show simple text without any html formatting.


Start a new Spring Starter Project and create a package for your controllers

Create a new controller called DaikichiController, and be sure you annotate it as a @RestController

Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi' display text that says 'Welcome!'

Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi/today' display text that says 'Today you will find luck in all your endeavors!'

Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/daikichi/tomorrow' display text that says 'Tomorrow, an opportunity will arise, so be sure to be open to new ideas!'
